# Analysis Of Variance:

## Background:

In this project, we have created a own dataset and performed Analysis of Variance. We have also performed the T Test and Tukey's range test. 

## Dataset:

We have created data using a numpy array for races. We have created the age for them using poisson's process and we have grouped them. We have performed ANOVA for the same mean. We have performed ANOVA for different means of the data. Later, we have done T Test and Pairwise Tukey Test.

## Libraries Used:

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scipy

Statsmodel

Numpy

## Run:

The entire coding is done by using the jupyter notebook. It can be installed by following the steps given in this [link](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Algorithm:

Here, we have  given the definition for the various algorithms that we have used. 

### Analysis Of Variance:

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means.

### T Test:

A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related to certain features. It is mostly used when the data sets would follow a normal distribution and may have unknown variances. 

### Pairwise Tukey Test:

Tukey's range test, also known as the Tukey's test, Tukey method, Tukey's honest significance test, or Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test,] is a single-step multiple comparison procedure and statistical test. It can be used to find means that are significantly different from each other.
