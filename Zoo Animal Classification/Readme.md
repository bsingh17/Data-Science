# Dataset Description 

Zoo animal classification dataset do consists of zoo animals and their different characterstics.

## Zoo Classification animal Dataset
in this project we will classify the zoo animals on the basis of there characterstics. this dataset has 101 animals data. 

## Background 

which do described by different traits. also there are seven main class of animals such as Mammal, Reptile, Fish, Bird, Amphibian, Invertibrate and Bug. The usecase of dataset is to predict the classification of the animals based on the characterstics available and variables. it is one of the best dataset to be used in Machine Learning.

## Data Set



## Associated tasks

	- Splitting up the data: 
		in order to solve this problem one needs to identify the elements which are needed for checking the animal class. also one needs to remove the variables which are not needed.
	
	- Applying several classification algorithms:  
		in this project you can apply different algorithms in order to find best accuracy of the data set. you should use the skicit library for classification algorithms
