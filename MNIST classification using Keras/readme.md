# Introduction:
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. 
Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. 
As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

# Dataset:
The data files contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. 
Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

# Project Description:
The following project aims to classify handwritten digits in the dataset using convolutional neural networks by using keras library.
