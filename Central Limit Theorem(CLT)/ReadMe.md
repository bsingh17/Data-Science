## Central Limit Theorem(CLT)
***"Given a dataset with unknown distribution (it could be uniform, binomial or completely random), the sample means will approximate to the normal distribution."***

### Requirement:
- Random
- Math
- Matplotlib

### Content 
  > * Probability distribution
  > * Normal distribution
  > * Sampling a distribution
  > * Central limit theorem
  > * Practical implementation : Tossing Coin
  > * Conclusion

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory ` Central Limit Theorem/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:


ipython notebook Central_limit_theorem_task.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook Central_limit_theorem_task.ipynb


This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
