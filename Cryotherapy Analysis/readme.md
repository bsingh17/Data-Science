# Cryotherapy Dataset:

## Background:

Cryotherapy is a pain treatment that uses a method of localized freezing temperatures to deaden an irritated nerve. Cryotherapy is also used as a method of treating localized areas of some cancers (called cryosurgery), such as prostate cancer and to treat abnormal skin cells by dermatologists.

In this project, we'll be observing the data available through the Cryotherapy dataset available on Kaggle and analyse about its result of treatment.
 
## Dataset Description:

The dataset has 90 entries with 7 columns. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mmkvarma/cryotherapy-analysis) which was originally contributed by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cryotherapy+Dataset+).

## Attribute Description:

Number_of_Warts

Type

Area

Result_of_Treatment

## Libraries Used:

Pandas

Matplotlib

Sklearn

Seaborn

Numpy

## Run:

The entire coding is done by using the jupyter notebook. It can be installed by following the steps given in this [link](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Algorithm:

This dataset can be dealt with various algorithms but here we are using AdaBoOst Classifier

### AdaBoost Classifier: 

An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.

## Tasks:

Here, we are learning to do

Data Handling

Importing Data with Pandas

Cleaning Data

Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

Building Machine Learning Models

Validation
