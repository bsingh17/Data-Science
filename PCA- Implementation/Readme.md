## Dermatology Database Project- PCA

In this project we are performing the implementation of the PCA(Principal Component Analysis), and using the classifier model to predict the ClassCode in the Dataset.

Dermatology dataset
---------------------------

**Data Set Characteristics:**

 * This database contains 34 attributes, 33 of which are linear
     valued and one of them is nominal.

         The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real
         problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of
         erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in
         this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus,
         pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris.
         Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately
         these diseases share many histopathological features as
         well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a
         disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning
         stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages.
         Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features.
         Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22
         histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features
         are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope.

     In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature
     has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the
     family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of
     the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was
     given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the
     feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible,
     and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

     The names and id numbers of the patients were recently
     removed from the database.

## PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations. PCA is either done by singular value decomposition of a design matrix or by doing the following 2 steps:

 1. Calculating the data covariance (or correlation) matrix of the original data
 2. Performing eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix
