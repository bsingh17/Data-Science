# Maximum Likelihood estimation:
In this project, you will implement and test linear regression by maximum likelihood estimation criteria using the gaussian function as a basis function to fit random noisy data we will generate, that represent the cosine function (plus noise).

You will implement this basic model from scratch. All the math will be done using the numpy library only. The sklearn library will only be used to split the data into a training and test set and for Gaussian Mixture Modelling.

# Background of the Dataset:
So we will generate 1000 single featue data points and add some noise to it. The target variable will be generated by taking cosine of data points plus noise.

# Additional Reading Material:
The basic concepts required for this project are explained in the notebook itself. But if you are interested in more mathematics behind it then you can refer to the below given links-
