    "# K-means Algorithm form Scratch\n",
    "K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.You’ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.Every data point is allocated to each of the clusters through reducing the in-cluster sum of squares.In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid."
